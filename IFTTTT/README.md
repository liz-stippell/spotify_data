# IFTTTT Workflow: Setting It Up
1. You will need [this IFTTTT applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/nin7BxVm-keep-a-log-of-your-recently-played-tracks) and connect it to an account with Google Sheets
2. Wait for your data to roll in as you listen to songs!
3. Make sure the Google Sheet that is created is open for viewing for anyone with a link
4. Copy the Google Sheet link <b>from the browser</b> (i.e. not the link that Sheets gives you to share, <i>yes they are different!</i>) insert it in <b>line 6</b> of the code
5. Add a row at the very top with the following headers: "date" "song" "artist" for columns a, b, and c
6. Run the code! (Feel free to change it accordingly, I usually run this at the end of each month to see my monthly round-up and other cool data facts)


This repository would not be possible without IFTTTT, Google Sheets, and wherever I got the `convert_google_sheet_url()` function.

Pull requests should be open. 


For testing, please feel free to use the `.xlsx` Excel spreadsheet (this is for more advanced users) OR use my Google Sheet with my Spotify wrapped: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AUxY8Cjr5MMgrTzoewKzGfqO1fnUzzkOBapEGpt1I7A/edit?gid=0#gid=0
